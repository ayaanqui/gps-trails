The Beehive Trail is a very popular moderate to difficult out and back or loop trail using iron rungs on ledges of exposed cliffs, and is very steep, offering spectacular views of Sand Beach and the surrounding area at Acadia National Park.  Start just north of and across the One way loop road from the Sand Beach parking area, climbing steps and through the forest to some exposed fairly flat rocky areas and a tall cairn of rocks marking your next steps.  Be sure to look for the light blue (Carolina Blue) trail markers as the trail can be quickly lost in your enthusiasm to scale the cliffs.  Stay on trail as strategically placed iron rungs, bridges and hand and foot holds take the technical part out of the climb.  Once at the top you can opt to go down the back side and make it a loop or go down the way you came. ",

There were a few coconut crabs along the trail and sensitive plants that have leaves that quickly close if you touch them. The views were amazing from the top.
